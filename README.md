# WebGL Shader-Blending Blobs 
  WebGl shader that uses raymarching to render three spheres, moves them around, and blends them together to create a *"lava lamp"* like effect. This was made to work with [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/), The steam workshop page for the wallpaper can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2025001091).
